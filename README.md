    <h1>Motivation</h1>
    <p>
      Imagine you are travelling ✈️ abroad, and you feel like you want to play
      some chess. You ask yourself, where to find if any tournaments are in this
      town? You start scrolling on facebook pages, maybe on
      <a href="http://chess-results.com/">chess-results.com</a> or in
      <a href="http://chess-results.com/"> chess-calendar.eu/</a>. But wouldn't
      be great if you can see in the map every tournament event? That's what
      I've tried to do in <b>geochess</b>, starting from my country Greece, I've
      tried to create a map with all the Tournaments that are registered in
      FIDE's database for the next 3 months.
